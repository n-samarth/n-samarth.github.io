      5G in healthcare and its challenges

      5G the fifth generation of cellular technologies promises to provide essential levels of connectivity to enable a new health care ecosystem conveniently, cost-effectively and at substantial scale. With the advent of tele-health and remote home monitoring systems, though, we could receive care from the comfort of our homes. Doctors could make recommendations after a short video call, and even submit prescription requests. However, this remote monitoring, along with sophisticated imaging equipment, can lead to additional strain on the networks. This often increases congestion and slows network. 5G opens entirely new horizons for telehealth and enables:
      Teleconsultation and transmitting large imaging files
      Improving AR, VR and spatial computing
      Reliable, real-time remote monitoring
      Enables Artificial intelligence
      Wearables and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)

      Sensor Innovation in medical device technology will provide more medical gadgets to patients who can reliably measure and monitor their health from home.
      Many key healthcare functions are beginning to use artificial intelligence (AI) to determine potential diagnoses and decide on the best treatment plan for a specific patient. Additionally, AI can help predict which patients are more likely to have post-operative complications, allowing healthcare systems to provide early interventions when necessary. The large amounts of data needed for real-time rapid learning require ultra-reliable and high-bandwidth networks. Additionally, providers often need to access data from their mobile devices. By moving to 5G networks, healthcare organizations can use the AI tools they need to provide the best care possible – from wherever they are in the hospital or clinic.

      security and data privacy challenges
      However to realise the full potential of 5G networks in healthcare settings, network security and data privacy are paramount. Among the many challenges are
      User training and potential error in technology adoption
      Medical device security becomes very important
      attackers can leverage greater speed and lower latency, Opportunities to access more data exist due to hyperconnectivity. Many more connected devices means additional opportunities for security through obscurity
      Disruption:  Dependency on low latency equates to vulnerability to disruption, The more you need instant communications the more significant the impact when you don’t have them. Egregious possibilities exist with telesurgery and other medical procedures performed by robots.
      DoS and DDoS attacks and  Jamming of 5G networks
      Data management, provenance and privacy for large scale monitored data is a challenge

    Prof Huzur Saran is with the Computer Science & Engineering Department at IIT Delhi. Prior to joining IIT Delhi in 1990, he did his Ph. D in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1989 and, a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering at the IIT Delhi in 1983. His research is focused on Computer Networks and Algorithms.  He is the former Head of the Department of Computer Science at IIT Delhi and also former  Head of the Amar Nath & Shashi Khosla School of IT, at IIT Delhi. Prof Saran has been actively working in 4G & 5G wireless technologies. During 2000-2002 he was a Visiting Professor at the Information Systems Lab, Stanford where he worked on the media access control layer of an exploratory 4G wireless systems. He has been investigating wireless access and mesh technologies to enable ICT for rural masses. Dr Saran has also been a consultant during 2004-2010 to Solidcore Inc, a Software Startup. During this time he helped define and build a novel software protection technology for critical servers and embedded products. Solidcore was purchased by Mcafee in 2009 for its pathbreaking Dynamic Whitelisting technology.</div>
