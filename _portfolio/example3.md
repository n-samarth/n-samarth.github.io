      The penetration of IoT into various spheres of our lives has opened new opportunities and associated challenges.
      What IoT inherently does is create islands of massively distributed and (at times) private datasets. In this changing
      landscape there is an increased need to provide alternatives to the classical centralised learning algorithms.
      Federated learning is emerging as a promising candidate technology to remedy the situation. It enables on-device
      ML without the need to migrate private end-user data to the cloud. It can thus address the privacy concerns which
      is central to healthcare applications. In this talk we will introduce federated learning and move on to explain its
      application to privacy preserving, secure healthcare solutions.
